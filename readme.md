## Dojo Examples

This repo is dedicated to showing small isolated examples of patterns generally used in gaming. These are not full projects, the goal is to just show the pattern in a small isolated way.

### Contributing

If you would like to contribute an example, please follow the following steps:

1. Create a new folder in the root of the repo with the name of your example.
2. Create a `README.md` file in the root of your example folder with a description of the example.
3. Create a Dojo project with a Scarb.toml
4. Complete the example along with sufficient comments and tests. It should be small and isolated.


Copy the example scaffold and rename it to your example name:

```
cp -r examples/example-scaffold examples/<example name>
```
